     * Task 5 - Stored Procedure
     * <p>
     * Cost: 1 points.
     * <p>
     * 1. Take the existing (or write from zero) JDBC solution with a few CRUD operations and more complex SQL
     * (for simple report generation) and migrate it to stored procedures. *
     * <p>
     * 2. Write SQL script to create those stored procedures with Java style parameters and specific external names. **
     * <p>
     * 3. Write a test which drops all stored procedures and creates a few of them via Java code.
     * <p>
     * 4. Also, provide the script to print out all stored procedure in your database and dropping them for test purposes,
     * for example.
     * <p>
     * 5. Check that the application works properly, all test are green and so on.
     * <p>
     * 6. Compare the performance of two solutions; explain to your mentor
     * the benefits or disadvantages of storage procedure usage for the taken application.
     * <p>
     * * 3-5 tables with CRUD operations and two complex SELECTs can be enough.
     * ** Use MySQL or PostgreSQL or Oracle.
